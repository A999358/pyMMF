# pyMMF

Simple module to find numerically the propagation modes and their corresponding propagation constants
of multimode fibers of arbitrary index profiles.


## What is it?

**pyMMF** is a simple module that allows finding the propagating modes of multimode fibers with arbitrary index profiles and simulate the transmission matrix for a given length.
The solver can also take into account the curvature of the fiber. 
This code is not designed to compete with commercially available software in term of accuracy of the mode profiles/propagation constants, it aims at quickly simulating realistic transmission matrices of short sections of fiber.
